Huffman Encoding and Decoding Algorithm:
Huffman coding is a widely used compression technique that efficiently encodes data, reducing its size for storage or transmission. This algorithm assigns shorter binary codes to more frequent symbols in a given dataset, optimizing compression. During encoding, it constructs a binary tree, with leaf nodes representing symbols and their frequencies. The most frequent symbols have shorter codes, reducing overall file size. Decoding follows the tree to reconstruct the original data. Huffman encoding is fast, lossless, and widely employed in data compression applications like file compression, image encoding, and network protocols. This GitHub repository includes an implementation of the Huffman encoding and decoding algorithm for your use.
